# Linear Regression
MatLab and Python code for use with the book:

[Linear Regression](https://jim-stone.staff.shef.ac.uk/Regression/) **by James V Stone**

Chapter 1 can be seen here https://jim-stone.staff.shef.ac.uk/Regression

Note that the book is principally about the mathematics of linear regression.
Each Matlab file here is printed at the end of one chapter in Linear Regression with Matlab.
Each Python file here is printed at the end of one chapter in Linear Regression with Python.
This repository is intended to provide 'taster' code, rather than an exercise in how to program regression. 

**Downloading Single Files**

Github normally insists you download the whole repository.
However, to download a single file
1) go to the file so you can see it in the github user interface 
2) click on the RAW button in the upper right
3) use the browser "save as ..." menu to save the file to your computer. 

OR
The complete set of Python or Matlab files can be downloaded in the two zip files in the Matlab or Python directories.

**System Requirements**

Each example has been tested on a mac (System Version:	OS X 10.15.7), MacBook Air 1.6GHz.
Python examples have been tested using the Spyder (3.3.2) python application with Python 3.7.0.
